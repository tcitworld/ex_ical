  While this covers many of the commonly-used properties of an iCal `VEVENT`,
  `ExIcal` does not yet have full coverage of all valid properties. More
  properties will be added over time, but if you need a legal iCalendar
  property that `ExIcal` does not yet support, please sumbit an issue on GitHub.
